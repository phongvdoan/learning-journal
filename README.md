# Who Am I?

![PIC](/img/Profilepic.jpg)


My name is Phong Vu Doan and I am a he. I met my wife while in college and joined the Army as a medic which would help me get into *medical school*. I was in the military for about nine years, having the opportunity to work with fantastic teams throughout the country and also out of states. During my time in Washington, I reinvigorated my passion for developing as I have done so while in high school using **Basic** and **C++**. I joined [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org) and volunteered my time to learn as much as I can and as fast as I can. I decided then that that was the path I would choose.
