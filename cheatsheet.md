# Types of Text Editors
  Text editors are software that allows a user to write and manage text. In web development there are many software applications that does this feat. The different types include the pre-installed **Notepad** on Window OS or **TextEdit** on MacOS. These text editors that come with the operating system does not have any syntax highlighting,themes, or even extensions like **Visual Studios** or **Notepad++**. There are word processors like **Microsoft Word** or **Google Docs**. And then there are Integrated Development Enviroments or IDEs which is a collective of a text editor, file manager, complier and debugger. 
  
  It is important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code because they are the ones writing the code and must be comfortable and an expert in their equipment. It is all about preferences, one person might be comfortable coding in ATOM because all the features allow the developer to do his/her job. On the other hand, another developer might prefer writing in Sublime because he/she knows that software. It is pretty much choice of what type of text editors one uses to be comfortable and efficient in executing the task.
