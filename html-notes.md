## Getting your message across using design
Designer needs to organize and prioritize information and the help users find what they need. Make parts of the page distinct from surrounding content. And group related content into blocks or chucks to make it simple. 
- Larger elements and ones with different style will grab users' attention first just as foreground and background color can do so with bright colors.
## Designing Navigation
Site navigation should be concise, clear, selective, provides context, interactive, and consistent.

# HTML5
- `<header>` and `<footer>` elements can be used as the main header or footer at the top or bottom of each page, or it can be used in each section within the page.
- `<nav>` is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site.
- If `<aside>` is used inside an `<article>` element, should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning like a glossary. If its used outside, it acts as a container for content that is related to the page.
- `<section>` element groups related content together with own heading. It may contain several `<article>` elements.
- `<hgroup>` element groups `<h1>` to `<h6>` elements.
- `<figure>` element is used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article. `<figcaption>` provides a text description for the content.
- `<div>` element is used to group together related elements.
- `<a>` element can be placed around a block level element that contains child elements which allows the block to be a link.
