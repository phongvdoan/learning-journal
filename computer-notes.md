# Computer Architecture and Logic
## What makes a computer?
Computers Do four basic tasks: input, store, process, output.
When connected to the internet one computers output can be another ones's input.
## Binary & Data
Computers work on ones and zeros but almost no one works directly with this. In a computer, wires and circuits carry all information. To store information in electricity by turning a wire on or off as a bit, the smallest piece of information a computer can store. The greater the wires, the greater the bits meaning more complex information can be stored. 
## Hardware and Software
The CPU is the masterchip that controls the rest of the computer. It has smaller simplier parts to do tasks, like math and logic. The CPU recieves simple commands to do a specific example. For example, and add command tells the CPU to use its adder circuit to calculate. Which all can be represented by binary numbers. The CPU fetches and executes them in sequence.

The Operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer. It installs and controls other software on the computer. It decides when the CPU runs the software and when the software accesses the input and output. The OS quickly switches between multiple programs to share the CPU.
