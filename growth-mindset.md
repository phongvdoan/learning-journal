# Growth Mindset

What does ***growth mindset*** mean to me? Itâ€™s the want, the determination, the drive, and the motivation in which an individual continuously learns. **Learning** is the keyword because as new technology or even break through knowledge emerges, one must be able to learn it to keep up with the needs and demands of consumers. There are a lot of people who are content with themselves, but individuals who strive to be better each day will improve the organization. I used to tell my subordinates that every day one must improve themselves and the organization by at least ten percent because there is always something to do and something to learn.

To keep myself in a growth mindset, I will remind myself

- That I am not perfect and can always improve.
- To view obstacles as an opportunity to learn.
- I need to grow with the team.
